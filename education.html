	<h1> My Education Experience</h1>
  <p>After finishing High Scholl in 2016,I did not immediately go to college, but took a two year gap-period.During that time, I travelled more and sought to find myself and have a better<br>
		 understanding of what I wanted for my life. I attribute that period in my life to the maturity, stabilty and growth that I developed and saw me excelling exceptionally when I finally<br>
		 went to college. I had experinced life in the real world, so in college I knew that I had to be on top of my game inorder to thrive in the world. Most of the students I went to college<br>
		 with did not have that same maturity and awareness about life that I had.</p>
		 <br>
		 <br>
		 <br>
	<p> Growing up, I had always wanted to become an engineer after university because of the passion and curiosity that I grew up with towards technology. Whenever I got a new toy, I would put<br>
		 it apart trying to see and understand how it had been made. Therefore, when I came for college, I knew I had to major in an enginnering major or technology major. My school did not have<br>
		 the kind of engineering major that I wanted, Aerospace Engineering, so I was left with Computer Information Systems as my next best option. For the past years that I have been in college,<br>
		 I have been enjoying my major very much because it also requires me to take classes in other fields like business. So, I am going to graduate with knowledge not only in my IT field but <br>
		 several others as well which will absolutely give me a competetive	edge in the corporate world. For a greater presentation of my skills and career journey thus far, I have attached my resume<br>
			below.</p>

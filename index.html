	<p id="ptext">From being a very ambitious and visionary boy In Zimbabwe, to now having braved my way through life and come to study in USA and become the first person ever in my family and community to<br>
		 go to college, I believe I have an extremely unique perspective about the world that I can bring to any community. I have been called a crazy dreamer, misunderstood, and booed before when<br>
		 I would express my ambitions to the people around me back in high school, but I have managed to achieve my dreams through believing in my abilities.I have lived in 3 countries on my own so<br>
		 far, and it keeps me so much self-pride and satisfaction when I think about it because Iget to realize how brave I am. I never hesitate to take initiatives and make that first leap of faith,<br>
		 because I am a strong believer that it is the ambitious and courageous people who get to realize their full potential in life and never the cowards<br>
